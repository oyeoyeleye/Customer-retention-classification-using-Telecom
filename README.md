Prediction of Churn is True or False: Using Telecom Dataset and making predictions using Classification Algorithms. Displaying Classification Metrics and compare algorithmâ€™s Classification Report and Confusion Matrix. Make predictions if a customer is likely to leave the network provider or Not.

Churn = False: Customer staying with current telecom network provider. Churn = True: Customer left the current telecom network provider.

# Telecom Churn Analysis

### Goal
A simple prediction if a customer is likely to leave a network provider or not using Pyspark.

### Summary
Prediction of Churn is True or False: Using Telecom Dataset and making predictions using Classification Algorithms. Displaying Classification Metrics and Confusion Matrix. 

Churn = False (:= 0): Customer staying with current telecom network provider. 
Churn = True (:= 1): Customer left the current telecom network provider.

##### Dataset Link: https://github.com/ammishra08/MachineLearning/blob/master/Datasets/churn-bigml-20.csv

### Result
 I was able to classify customers that are likely to leave or stay with an accuracy of 80%. Confusion Matrix was done to see the proportion of the correctly predicted customers vs the actual status of the customers.
